# ReadMyCode

## Instructions

Find the value of my `secret` environment variable.  Succeed, and you may send it along with your resume to l33thacker@covermymeds.com.  Fail, and you will be consumed by a 6' tall turkey with steak knives on it's feet.

## Production deploy target

This app is deployed to `http://read-my-code.herokuapp.com`

## Starting the development server

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:dapplebeforedawn/read-my-code.git read-my-code
  cd read-my-code
  bundle install
  foreman start
```

Then you can visit `http://localhost:9292`

You do not need to run a development server to complete this exercise.
